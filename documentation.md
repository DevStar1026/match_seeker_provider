### **System Architecture Overview**  
The Seeker-Provider Matching Application follows a **client-server architecture** where a **Flask-based backend** handles API requests, authentication, and business logic, while a **React frontend** provides an interface for users. The application stores user data in a **PostgreSQL database**, and authentication is managed using **JWT tokens** for secure access. The matching functionality is implemented as a simple filtering mechanism based on shared attributes like **industry and location**. The entire application is containerized using **Docker** to ensure seamless deployment across environments.

### **Basic Flow Diagram**  
Hereâ€™s a high-level flow of how the system functions:

```plaintext
                +------------------+
                |   User (Seeker)  |
                +------------------+
                          |
                          v
                +--------------------+
                |   React Frontend   |
                +--------------------+
                          |
                          v
                +--------------------+
                |  Flask Backend API |
                | (Authentication,   |
                |  Matching Logic)   |
                +--------------------+
                          |
          +---------------+---------------+
          |                               |
+--------------------+         +----------------------+
| PostgreSQL (Users, |         | Matching Algorithm   |
| Profiles, Matches) |         | (Filters Providers)  |
+--------------------+         +----------------------+
```

1. A **Seeker** or **Provider** registers and logs in.
2. The **backend authenticates** users using **JWT tokens**.
3. Seekers can update preferences (e.g., industry, location), while Providers update their service details.
4. The system **matches Seekers with Providers** based on shared attributes.
5. The front-end fetches and displays **matched Providers** to the Seeker.

### **Known Limitations & Future Enhancements**  
#### **Limitations**:
- The matching logic is **basic**, relying only on shared attributes like location and industry.  
- **No real-time communication** (e.g., messaging between Seekers and Providers).  
- **Limited security measures** (e.g., no OAuth or multi-factor authentication).  
- The UI is **minimalistic** and lacks advanced filtering options.

#### **Enhancements**:
- Implement **machine learning-based matching** to improve accuracy.  
- Add **real-time chat** between Seekers and Providers.  
- Introduce **OAuth authentication** for easier login options.  
- Enhance the **UI/UX** for better navigation and usability.  
- Scale the backend using **Kubernetes** for better performance.  

This would make the application more scalable, secure, and user-friendly while improving the efficiency of the matching process. ðŸš€
